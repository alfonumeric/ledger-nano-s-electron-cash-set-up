# ledger-nano-s-electron-cash-set-up
to circumvent nano's inability to detect 1-sat fees
outstanding questions
1) why do all 3 account addresses not show up in elctron?
2) even with all this set up my txs are still unconfirmed after 24 hours
there are many people saying this fix works great ...so we are missing a piece of the puzzle
